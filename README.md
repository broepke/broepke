### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science and Analytics leader for a large cloud platform. I spent most of my career in Product Management and product leadership, building multiple products from zero to long-term sustainable businesses.

Since around 2018, I've been studying Machine Learning and Analytics, even as far as graduating with a BSc in Data Analytics in 2021. I took the opportunity to transform my career and move full-time into this new field.

I am a certified practitioner of Human-Centered Design and love utilizing Design Thinking methods and techniques to bring out the best in people and build the most innovative, inclusive solutions. I leverage my long history in product management to deliver everything I do, from ML pipelines to Dashboards as products. I focus on delivering high value, great user experience, and the right outcomes.

I try to contribute small articles in this blog that might help new and aspiring Data Science professionals. I hope you enjoy it. Leave comments and I'll respond as soon as I can.
